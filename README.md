## Initialization
The expert advisor is initialized in the `OnInit()` function. It initializes the trade object and the moving average object with the specified symbol, timeframe, period, method, and price.

## Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is being shut down. It performs necessary cleanup by deinitializing the trade and moving average objects.
